===================================

   Plot of a `Molniya orbit`_ around the Earth
   (\\(a = 26600\\,\\mathrm{km}, e = 0.75,
   i = 63.4 \\mathrm{{}^{\\circ}} \\)).

poliastro is an open source collection of Python subroutines useful in
Astrodynamics and Orbital Mechanics. It tries to provide a simple and
intuitive API and handles physical quantities with units (thanks to
:code:`astropy.units`). Some of its features are:

* Orbit propagation
* Conversion between position and velocity vectors and classical orbital
  elements
* Hohmann and bielliptic maneuvers computation
* Trajectory plotting

And more to come!

The `source code`_, `issue tracker`_ and `wiki`_ are hosted on GitHub, and all
contributions and feedback are more than welcome.

.. _`wiki`: https://github.com/Pybonacci/poliastro/wiki/

poliastro works on both Python 2 and 3 and is released under a 2-clause
BSD license, hence allowing commercial use of the library.

.. code-block:: python

    from poliastro.examples import molniya
    from poliastro.plotting import plot
    
    plot(molniya)

poliastro relies on some Fortran subroutines written by David A. Vallado for
his book "Fundamentals of Astrodynamics and Applications" and available on
the Internet as the `companion software of the book`__.
The author explicitly gave permission to redistribute these subroutines
in this project under the current license.
