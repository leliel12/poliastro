Defining the orbit: :code:`State` objects
-----------------------------------------

The core of poliastro are the :py:class:`~poliastro.twobody.State` objects
inside the :py:mod:`poliastro.twobody` module. They store all the required
information to define an orbit:

* The body acting as the central body of the orbit, for example the Earth.
* The position and velocity vectors or the orbital elements.
* The time at which the orbit is defined.

First of all, we have to import the relevant modules and classes:

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    from astropy import units as u
    
    from poliastro.bodies import Earth, Sun
    from poliastro.twobody import State

From position and velocity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several methods available to create
:py:class:`~poliastro.twobody.State` objects. For example, if we have the
position and velocity vectors we can use
:py:meth:`~poliastro.twobody.State.from_vectors`:

.. code-block:: python

    # Data from Curtis, example 4.3
    r = [-6045, -3490, 2500] * u.km
    v = [-3.457, 6.618, 2.533] * u.km / u.s
    
    ss = State.from_vectors(Earth, r, v)

And that's it! Notice a couple of things:

* Defining vectorial physical quantities using Astropy units is terribly easy.
  The list is automatically converted to a :code:`Quantity`, which is actually
  a subclass of NumPy arrays.
* If no time is specified, then a default value is assigned::

    >>> ss.epoch
    <Time object: scale='utc' format='jyear_str' value=J2000.000>
    >>> ss.epoch.iso
    '2000-01-01 12:00:00.000'

.. figure:: _static/curtis.png
   :align: right
   :figwidth: 350
   :alt: Plot of the orbit

If we're working on interactive mode (for example, using the wonderful IPython
notebook) we can immediately plot the current state::

    >>> from poliastro.plotting import plot
    >>> plot(ss)

This plot is made in the so called *perifocal frame*, which means:

* we're visualizing the plane of the orbit itself,
* the \\(x\\) axis points to the pericenter, and
* the \\(y\\) axis is turned \\(90 \\mathrm{^\\circ}\\) in the
  direction of the orbit.

The dotted line represents the *osculating orbit*:
the instantaneous Keplerian orbit at that point. This is relevant in the
context of perturbations, when the object shall deviate from its Keplerian
orbit.

From classical orbital elements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can also define a :py:class:`~poliastro.twobody.State` using a set of
six parameters called orbital elements. Although there are several of
these element sets, each one with its advantages and drawbacks, right now
poliastro supports the *classical orbital elements*:

* Semimajor axis \\(a\\).
* Eccentricity \\(e\\).
* Inclination \\(i\\).
* Right ascension of the ascending node \\(\\Omega\\).
* Argument of pericenter \\(\\omega\\).
* True anomaly \\(\\nu\\).

In this case, we'd use the method
:py:meth:`~poliastro.twobody.State.from_elements`:

.. code-block:: python

    # Data for Mars at J2000 from JPL HORIZONS
    a = 1.523679 * u.AU
    ecc = 0.093315 * u.one
    inc = 1.85 * u.deg
    raan = 49.562 * u.deg
    argp = 286.537 * u.deg
    nu = 23.33 * u.deg
    
    ss = State.from_elements(Sun, a, ecc, inc, raan, argp, nu)

Notice that whether we create a ``State`` from \\(r\\) and \\(v\\) or from
elements we can access many mathematical properties individually::

    >>> ss.period.to(u.day)
    <Quantity 686.9713888628166 d>
    >>> ss.v
    <Quantity [  1.16420211, 26.29603612,  0.52229379] km / s>

To see a complete list of properties, check out the
:py:class:`poliastro.twobody.State` class on the API reference.

Changing the orbit: :code:`Maneuver` objects
--------------------------------------------

poliastro helps us define several in-plane and general out-of-plane
maneuvers with the :py:class:`~poliastro.maneuver.Maneuver` class inside the
:py:mod:`poliastro.maneuver` module.

Each ``Maneuver`` consists on a list of impulses \\(\\Delta v_i\\)
(changes in velocity) each one applied at a certain instant \\(t_i\\). The
simplest maneuver is a single change of velocity without delay: you can
recreate it either using the :py:meth:`~poliastro.maneuver.Maneuver.impulse`
method or instantiating it directly.

.. code-block:: python

    dv = [5, 0, 0] * u.m / u.s
    
    man = Maneuver.impulse(dv)
    man = Maneuver((0 * u.s, dv))  # Equivalent

There are other useful methods you can use to compute common in-plane
maneuvers, notably :py:meth:`~poliastro.maneuver.Maneuver.hohmann` and
:py:meth:`~poliastro.maneuver.Maneuver.bielliptic` for `Hohmann`_ and
`bielliptic`_ transfers respectively. Both return the corresponding
``Maneuver`` object, which in turn you can use to calculate the total cost
in terms of velocity change (\\(\\sum \|\\Delta v_i|\\)) and the transfer
time::

    >>> ss_i = State.circular(Earth, alt=700 * u.km)
    >>> hoh = Maneuver.hohmann(ss_i, 36000 * u.km)
    >>> hoh.get_total_cost()
    <Quantity 3.6173981270031357 km / s>
    >>> hoh.get_total_time()
    <Quantity 15729.741535747102 s>

You can also retrieve the individual vectorial impulses::

    >>> hoh.impulses[0]
    (<Quantity 0 s>, <Quantity [ 0.        , 2.19739818, 0.        ] km / s>)
    >>> hoh[0]  # Equivalent
    (<Quantity 0 s>, <Quantity [ 0.        , 2.19739818, 0.        ] km / s>)
    >>> tuple(_.decompose([u.km, u.s]) for _ in hoh[1])
    (<Quantity 15729.741535747102 s>, <Quantity [ 0.        , 1.41999995, 0.        ] km / s>)

.. _Hohmann: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohmann_transfer_orbit
.. _bielliptic: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bi-elliptic_transfer

To actually retrieve the resulting ``State`` after performing a maneuver, use
the method :py:meth:`apply_maneuver`::

    >>> ss_f = ss_i.apply_maneuver(hoh)
    >>> ss_f.rv()
    (<Quantity [ -3.60000000e+04, -7.05890200e-11, -0.00000000e+00] km>, <Quantity [ -8.97717523e-16, -3.32749489e+00, -0.00000000e+00] km / s>)

More advanced plotting: :code:`OrbitPlotter` objects
----------------------------------------------------

We previously saw the :py:func:`poliastro.plotting.plot` function to easily
plot orbits. Now we'd like to plot several orbits in one graph (for example,
the maneuver me computed in the previous section). For this purpose, we
have :py:class:`~poliastro.plotting.OrbitPlotter` objects in the
:py:mod:`~poliastro.plotting` module.

These objects hold the perifocal plane of the first ``State`` we plot in
them, projecting any further trajectories on this plane. This allows to
easily visualize in two dimensions:

.. code-block:: python

    from poliastro.plotting import OrbitPlotter
    
    op = OrbitPlotter()
    ss_a, ss_f = ss_i.apply_maneuver(hoh, intermediate=True)
    op.plot(ss_i)
    op.plot(ss_a)
    op.plot(ss_f)

Which produces this beautiful plot:

.. figure:: _static/hohmann.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Hohmann transfer
   
   Plot of a Hohmann transfer.

And that's it for the basics of poliastro! Feel free to send my your
suggestions of improvement, both for the code and the docs.
